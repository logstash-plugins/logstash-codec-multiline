# The multiline codec will collapse multiline messages and merge them into a
# single event.
#
# The original goal of this codec was to allow joining of multiline messages
# from files into a single event. For example, joining Java exception and
# stacktrace messages into a single event.
#
# The config looks like this:
# [source,ruby]
#     input {
#       stdin {
#         codec => multiline {
#           pattern => "pattern, a regexp"
#           negate => "true" or "false"
#           what => "previous" or "next"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
# The `pattern` should match what you believe to be an indicator that the field
# is part of a multi-line event.
#
# The `what` must be `previous` or `next` and indicates the relation
# to the multi-line event.
#
# The `negate` can be `true` or `false` (defaults to `false`). If `true`, a
# message not matching the pattern will constitute a match of the multiline
# filter and the `what` will be applied. (vice-versa is also true)
#
# For example, Java stack traces are multiline and usually have the message
# starting at the far-left, with each subsequent line indented. Do this:
# [source,ruby]
#     input {
#       stdin {
#         codec => multiline {
#           pattern => "^\s"
#           what => "previous"
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
# This says that any line starting with whitespace belongs to the previous line.
#
# Another example is to merge lines not starting with a date up to the previous
# line..
# [source,ruby]
#     input {
#       file {
#         path => "/var/log/someapp.log"
#         codec => multiline {
#           # Grok pattern names are valid! :)
#           pattern => "^%{TIMESTAMP_ISO8601} "
#           negate => true
#           what => previous
#         }
#       }
#     }
#
# This says that any line not starting with a timestamp should be merged with the previous line.
#
# One more common example is C line continuations (backslash). Here's how to do that:
# [source,ruby]
#     filter {
#       multiline {
#         type => "somefiletype"
#         pattern => "\\$"
#         what => "next"
#       }
#     }
#
# This says that any line ending with a backslash should be combined with the
# following line.
